## About

dcm_qa_pdt2 is a simple DICOM to NIfTI validator script and dataset. This repository is similar to [dcm_qa](https://github.com/neurolabusc/dcm_qa), but illustrates a Proton-Density plus T2-weighted [PD+T2](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/223#issuecomment-1471528927) sequence.

Assuming that the executable dcm2niix is in your path, you should be able to simply run the script `batch.sh` from the terminal.
